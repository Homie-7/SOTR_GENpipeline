## Sessions

### 2026-09-21 — PREP, all three looks locked, cards and IMG prompts written

**Locked with Homie.** Salon: Soubise white-and-gold with crimson silk, a trumeau mirror on
CENTRE, LIT plus a DARK state made as an NBP edit, true scale with a 3.2 m panel line.
Louis XVIII's portrait on LEFT (the salon's solo wall), composited from Gérard. Studio: the
whole Raft painting scaled to a 3.2 × 4.7 m canvas (liberty taken so the apex reads at beat
9), window on RIGHT, limb studies only. Court: **a judge in a robe** (not the naval officer),
and the **strike is generated** as image-to-video from the still, with a Q5 fallback.

**house-rules conflicts, project files followed:** "three-quarter, never frontal" (STAGE
wants square-on), "rule of thirds" (walls are symmetrical). Also fixed LOOK's model routing
to Soul Cinema for plates and NBP for edits, and cut the prompts to the ~2,000-character cap.

**Written:** 9 IMG prompts plus the DARK template in `prompts/`, built from the locked
prefixes and room contents, and checked word for word against `LOOK.md` and
`SHOTCARDS.md`. **Nothing generated.** Homie playtests next.

**Standing preference (Homie):** the worlds are ours to shape, not literal copies of
references or history.

**Same session, Homie's direction:** (1) **every object lives whole on one wall.** Nothing
straddles a seam. Each wall is a complete composition, and only architecture, light and
colour cross. Written into CLAUDE.md, STAGE.md and the seam check in PIPELINE.md, and added
to the room contents of every prompt. (2) The court's Q4/Q5 broke that rule, so they became
a **tribunal of three**: whole judges on L and R (R mirrored) striking in unison, and at Q5
each wall gets its own gavel. (3) **Floor projection is parked, not ruled out.**

**Open:** The wall-by-beat map
needs director sign-off. Aspect ratios per model still unlogged. Loop prompts and
S9-CRT-STRIKE wait for a VID session.

### 2026-09-21 — PREP, setup

Read the full source folder: the workshop script, work schedule, visual references, 2022
presentation, staging plan v0.2, UE5/Unity snapshots and both 2022 dev-showing videos.
Scope set with Homie: Scene 9 Court Martial, Salon and Studio, in about one week. Staging:
three surfaces (L 4800 × 3600, C 6000 × 3600, R 4800 × 3600, flats at 25°), cameras
locked. Decided: walls-as-walls rendering, transitions in compositing, the Raft painting
composited. Proposed, **not locked**: all three world looks, the naval-officer silhouette,
the wall-by-beat map.

Same day, Homie's direction: work at 1080p and upscale approved results to 4K. No projector
spec needed, because the mapping software does the final fit. Sound is a separate designer,
and our timing leads. Goal: one cohesive video across three screens. Adopted Homie's order
(cards, then front, left, right) and added two things: a **room master** before the front
camera, and a **wide-canvas master comp** (4680 × 1080) where every cross-screen event is
built. Written up as `PIPELINE.md`.

Frame rate: native is fine (24 OK), higher when a model offers it. No forced
interpolation. Post VFX is an optional upgrade; generation comes first.

Salon research: the Cooper Hewitt Restoration salon (buff and blue, restrained) against
the script and references (old-regime gilt, Hôtel de Soubise). Recommended gilt. Four open
choices logged in `LOOK.md`. Found Homie's 2022 studio concept (Slide 9), the only prior
Scene 9 visual, and noted it as the studio's starting layout. Added
`docs/HANDOVER-WINDOWS.md` for the PC.
